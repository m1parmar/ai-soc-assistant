SOC Assistant (API + LLM Edition)

SOC Assistant is an advanced, AI-powered security operations chatbot that helps SOC analysts quickly gather intelligence on IP addresses, threat actors, malware, CVEs, and other cybersecurity-related topics. It leverages VirusTotal for IP reputation and Hugging Faceâ€™s Mistral-7B-Instruct model to generate human-readable summaries and insights.

Features:
- IP Reputation Lookup: Query any IP address and get a detailed reputation summary from VirusTotal, explained in SOC analyst terms by an AI.
- Threat Actor and Malware Intelligence: Ask about threat actors, malware families, or CVEs, and get summarized insights directly from the AI.
- Conversational Interface: Simple command-line chat loop for easy interaction.
- Extensible: Can be extended to integrate additional threat intelligence APIs or knowledge bases in the future.
